<h3>Architecture</h3>

This project uses MVVM as its architecture. This was done because MVVM allows for zero dependency between the views and the business logic which will prevent any memory leaks throughout the lifecycle of the app.
It allows for two-way communication between the view and the viewModel. It's also great for testing purposes.
